Polygraph tests measure a subject's physical responses to questions
posed by the polygraph operator. Advocates say it is a valid detection
device. Critics call it inaccurate and intrusive. This has been argued
for years. Courts do not generally accept polygraph results. Unbiased
reports place the accuracy rate at 50 to 95 percent. Private companies
used polygraphs extensively through 1987. Since 1988 federal law
prohibits their use in screening prospective employees, and cannot
test workers randomly. Security service firms and drug companies are
exempt from the law. Public safety organizations and certain federal
agencies can still use polygraphs.
