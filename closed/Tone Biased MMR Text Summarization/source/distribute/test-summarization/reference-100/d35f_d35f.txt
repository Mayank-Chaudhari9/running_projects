Genes which oversee the body's production of interferon may play a
role in warding off cancer development.  Loss of those genes occurred
in patients with lymphoblastic leukemia, the third leading killer of
children.  A study of 248,046 US veterans showed that heavy smokers
were nearly twice as likely to die from monocytic and myeloid
leukemias as non-smokers.  No causal link is yet proved, but if found,
smoking would be identified as a more important cause of leukemia than
all other known causes combined.  A new drug, 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine,
or 2-CdA, appears to be effective against hairy cell leukemia
