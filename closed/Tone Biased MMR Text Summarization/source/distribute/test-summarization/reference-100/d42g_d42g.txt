On 29 May 1990, Russian lawmakers elected Boris N. Yeltsin president
of the Soviet Union's largest republic, an important setback for
Mikhail Gorbachev, USSR President and Community Party General
Secretary.  On 30 May, Yeltsin met with legislators to form a
coalition government and called for autonomy of the Russian and
remaining 14 republics.

On 12 June 1991, he won the first democratic election for presidency
of the Russian Republic.  On 14 June, he began work with Gorbachev on
drafting new principles decentralizing power.  On 19 August, Yeltsin
led protestors forcing the capitulation of hard-liners who had taken
power in a coup.
