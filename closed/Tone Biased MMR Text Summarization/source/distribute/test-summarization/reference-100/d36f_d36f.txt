Senator Kennedy and Congressman Hawkins propose raising the minimum
hourly wage from $3.35 to $4.65.  The Reagan Administration will
oppose the increase unless the rate is lowered and coupled with a
sub-minimum training wage.  Most observers believe that some raising
of the rate is justified since the present rate is not sufficient to
permit workers to meet the poverty level.  Labor views the training
wage as an opening for employers to replace higher salaried workers
with new employees.  Congress eventually passed a bill topping the
rate at $4.25 with many compromises on both sides but most on the part
of Congress.
