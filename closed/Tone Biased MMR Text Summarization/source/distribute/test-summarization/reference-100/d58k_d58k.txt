The gun control argument rages within the United States, and the
country is deeply divided between those who favor various levels of
arms ownership restrictions and those who oppose all such laws.

Some law enforcement officials and politicians, alarmed by the rising
statistics, have joined forces against powerful members of the gun
lobby.  Many face defeat at the polls as the NRA and others work
furiously to defend their position.

Gun owners' lobbies argue that criminals are the problem and will
obtain guns despite any restrictions.  They argue for stiffer
penalties.  The Second Amendment is their legal foundation and bottom
line.
