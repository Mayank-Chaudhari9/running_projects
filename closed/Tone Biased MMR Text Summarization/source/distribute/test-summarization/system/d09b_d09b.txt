";    Among the requirements for Iraq, said Fitzwater, was that
withdrawal from Kuwait City must be complete within 48 hours and from the
country of Kuwait in one week. And even terrorist groups that opposed Iraq in
its war with Iran show signs of swinging behind Saddam
Hussein now that he is in a confrontation with the U.S.
   And Iraq still has thousands of Americans and other
Westerners under its control in Iraq and Kuwait. ;    Bush said Saddam "risks
subjecting the Iraqi people to further hardship unless the Iraqi government
complies fully" with the demands. President Bush today denounced Saddam's ``ruinous policies of
war,'' and said the United States is ``striking a blow for the
principle that might does not make right.'' The problem is
exacerbated by the growing likelihood, acknowledged privately
by Bush administration aides, that Saddam Hussein will
survive in power for at least a while longer.
