Researchers who developed and tested the medicine report that it
``may well be the drug of choice in the treatment of hairy cell
leukemia.'' The drug, called 2-CdA, was nearly 100% effective treating
12 patients with hairy-cell leukemia. They wrote that it was ``the largest study of leukemia and
smoking habits to date (and) represents additional evidence that
leukemia is a smoking-related disease.'' But neither drug is as effective as 2-CdA appears to be in
low doses and both can cause such side effects as nausea,
vomiting, skin rashes and nervous-system disorders,
researchers say. "It's ironic that we have three active drugs for
a disease that's fairly rare, but for some of the more common
forms of leukemia, we don't yet have good treatments."
