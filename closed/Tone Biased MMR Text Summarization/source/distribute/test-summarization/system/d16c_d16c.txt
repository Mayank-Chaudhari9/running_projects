The Richter scale is a measure of energy released by an
earthquake as recorded on seismographs. ``It wasn't very heavy at Juba. It was measured at 4.6 on the
scale and caused some injuries and property damage. It is the first time
that such a quake has struck this area.'' ``Most casualties from earthquakes are caused by something
falling on top of you,'' said Needham in a telephone interview from
Golden, Colo.
