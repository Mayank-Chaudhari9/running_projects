"If a lawmaker is looking 
for an excuse to vote with the NRA, all he has to say is, 'I got a hundred 
calls from the NRA, but none from the other side,' " said a congressional aide. Criminals are.'' In the process they have
lost touch with many of their members, who back gun control in general and
specifically the Brady bill. ``I'm a sportsman, I'm a hunter, (I) like to do it, and I don't
believe we need the federal government going forward with gun
control legislation,'' Bush told a rally in Billings, Mont. Strategists for the task force conceded that assuring hunters, collectors and 
sportsmen that their guns are "safe" and would not be affected by the bill is a 
key element in winning its approval by a Legislature highly sensitive to 
gun-owning constituents.
