Witnesses back King's version of what happened early Sunday morning in a Los
Angeles suburb, and a CHP officer at the scene said he exhorted the police
officers to stop the beating, but was told, in effect, to "stay out of it,"

beaten was black, I wasn't surprised. ;  
 King said that police "continued to pound on me and beat on me all over my
body . The Los Angeles Police Department is also
investigating. ;    On his recent visits, he said, King
was having difficulty remembering the night of the beating in a coherent way.
