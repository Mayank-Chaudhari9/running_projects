In August 1990, Iraq invaded then annexed Kuwait.  The United States
began a massive regional military buildup.  The United Nations imposed
a total trade embargo on Iraq.  After months of failed diplomatic
efforts, a U.S. led allied military force began a massive bombardment
of Iraqi infrastructure and military.  This was followed weeks later
with a massive ground attack against Iraqi troops.  The allied force
won a surprisingly quick victory and Saddam Hussein accepted
U.N. conditions for a ceasefire.  U.N. economic sanctions would
continue until all chemical and biological weapons and missiles were
destroyed and reparations paid.  Saddam remained in power
