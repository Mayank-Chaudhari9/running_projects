On June 6, Rodney King, of Los Angeles, was stopped by police after a
high speed chase.  Witnesses said that as he left the car he was shot
with a stun gun, kicked and beaten by police as he lay helpless.

One of many witnesses videotaped the incident.  The tape made its way
to national TV and has caused a public furor.  Police, FBI and the
District Attorney are investigating.  A number of policemen have been
suspended and some indicted for assault.

Mr. King required hospital treatment for facial and leg fractures.  He
was not charged
