After disastrous eruptions in the 1980s, the US Geological Survey
studied volcanic histories and developed expendable, remotely
transmitting forecasting instruments that could be optimally
placed. Eruptions were predicted for Alaska's Redoubt Volcano in 1989
and the Philippines' Pinatubo in 1991. In 1986, Colombia's officials
ignored warnings of the Nevado del Ruiz eruption and 25,000
died. Residents of California's Long Valley, a volcanic caldera,
ignored small earthquakes triggered by new underground lava movement,
remembering a 1982 false alarm that damaged the tourist- based
economy. Volcanic dust's cooling effect is minimal because solar heat
blocked by dust is balanced by trapped earth heat
