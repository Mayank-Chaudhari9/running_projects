Twenty-seven million people are facing drought and famine in Africa.

The hunger problem is complicated by the refusal of some governments
to supply rebel-held areas; some imported food supplies have been
hijacked.

Donor countries are hard-pressed to supply food relief.

About 10 countries in southern Africa and the Horn area are the
countries afflicted.  Distribution of imported food is a problem
because of limited transport facilities.

Lack of rain is also causing a loss of electric power production.

Some African leaders believe that a reduction in global warming by the
industrial nations will alleviate the drought problem in
Africa.
