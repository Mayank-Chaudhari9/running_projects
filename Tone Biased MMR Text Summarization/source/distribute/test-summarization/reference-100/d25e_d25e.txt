Charles Keating began his adult years as an athlete and a fighter
pilot during World War II.

He began a promising career as a lawyer.  Peers described him as
aggressive, impatient and a risk-taker.  As he began to build his
business and financial empire, he could best be described as dishonest
and deceptive.

Keating did not have the courage to follow his political beliefs.
These convictions were compromised when he made heavy contributions
only to those politicians who could assist him.

Tha law finally caught up with Charles Keating.  He was unable to come
to terms with his guilt.
