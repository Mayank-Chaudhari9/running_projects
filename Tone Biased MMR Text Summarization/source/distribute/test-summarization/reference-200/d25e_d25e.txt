Charles Keating of Lincoln Savings and Loan existed in a world of high
finance, political influence and greed.

He bought political influence from any source that would help him to
build and protect his business and financial empire.

Keating was a star athlete and a fighter pilot during World War II. He
began his career as a lawyer.  His peers described him as aggressive,
impatient and a risk taker and these words, plus "dishonest" and
"deceptive" would describe his later career.

He also believed that he was above the law.  He expected politicians
to whom he had given contributions to protect him and his business
when needed.

Although describing himself as a conservative Republican, Keating made
contributions to federal and state politicians who he felt could
assist him regardless of political affiliations.

Family members were also brought into Keating's illegal activities and
they became high spenders of funds drawn from Lincoln Savings and Loan
for their personal use.

Charles Keating's world was false and deceptive.  When the law finally
caught up to his illegal activities, he was unable to come to terms
with his guilt and the fact that he drove so many people, many of
limited means, to financial ruin.
