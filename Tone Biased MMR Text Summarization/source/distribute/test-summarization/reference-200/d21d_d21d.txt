There is increasing concern in the National Transportation Safety Board that there needs 
to be major improvements in the cruise ship industry to avert a major disaster. The 
board's primary concern is fire protection.

In 1988, the chairman of a federal agency investigating a March engine-room fire aboard 
the Scandinavian Star said safety standards may not be stringent enough in the cruise 
industry.  Since then, many incidents have occurred that could have caused serious loss of 
life. 

Between 1986-1991 several potentially disastrous incidents occurred. More than 3,000 
passengers and crew were evacuated from the Sovereign of the Seas after a fire broke out 
in a pantry. Carnival Cruise Lines' Celebration cut a Cuban freighter in half killing three 
Cuban sailors. The Song of America was forced to return to port after a small fire.  The 
Regent Star ran aground in the Delaware Bay after a fire cut off power to the ship. There 
were also fires on two Soviet passenger ships and an acetylene-fueled fire erupted in an 
engine store room on the Panamanian ship Emerald Seas. 

The NTSB is pushing for legislation that would give the U.S. Coast Guard the authority 
to enforce U.S. safety rules on foreign-flag vessels calling at U.S. ports.
