In a polygraph test monitors attached to a subject's body measure the
body's physical responses as he answers questions asked by the
polygraph operator. Changes in the subject's blood pressure, breathing
and sweating patterns indicate if he is lying.  Supporters of
polygraph use claim it is a valid detection tool. Critics say it is an
invasion of privacy that yields faulty results.

Use of polygraphs has always been a controversial issue. The
Congressional Office of Technology Assessment has estimated that the
accuracy of polygraph results varies from 50 to 95 percent. Their
results are generally not accepted in court.

Polygraphs were widely used through 1987. Two million polygraph tests
were conducted during 1987, about 90 percent of them by private
companies. In 1988 a federal statute outlawed most of the testing done
by private firms. They could no longer use polygraphs to screen
prospective employees, and those already working could be tested only
to investigate a specific incident. Firms in the security business and
those producing controlled substances were exempt. The 1988 law did
not cover state and local public safety organizations or to sensitive
federal agencies.
