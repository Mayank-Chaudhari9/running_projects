To reduce the chances of a cruise-ship disaster, the safety board is pushing for legislation that would give the U.S. Coast Guard the authority to enforce U.S. safety rules on foreign-flag vessels. ``Any time you have a fire it's a big deal, but it was quickly
brought under control,'' Steck said. ;   American passengers frequently assume that any ship they
board in a U.S. port has met all Coast Guard safety requirements, a notion
reinforced by "Coast Guard approved" labels on most life jackets, and fire
systems on smaller boats and domestic ferries. There are no casualties
among the passengers,'' Tass said. ``The potential for loss of life is enormous.''
