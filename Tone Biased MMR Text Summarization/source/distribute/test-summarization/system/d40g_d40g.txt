Powell, 52, was nominated on Thursday by President Bush to
become the nation's top military officer. ;  
 So if Powell, who is only 53, has a future in national politics it is likely
to come in 1996. He was a key figure in the
planning of Reagan's national security strategy and for his summits
with Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev. ;    Though some blacks have criticized
Powell for being too cautious in addressing issues of concern to
African-Americans, he has, on several occasions, pointedly indicated that he
has not forgotten those struggles. The questions about his future were spurred by a column in
Wednesday's Washington post by William Raspberry suggesting that it
would be a ``brilliant idea'' for Bush to pick Powell as his
running mate.
