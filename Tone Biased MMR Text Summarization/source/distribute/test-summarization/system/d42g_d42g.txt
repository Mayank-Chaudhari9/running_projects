elected by Russians," Gorbachev said. He proclaimed his respect
for the Soviet people and, specifically, Mr. Yeltsin and said

  As the race for the Russian presidency entered its last days, the campaign
turned dirty, with newspaper allegations that front-runner Boris Yeltsin is
emotionally unstable, that he tried to commit suicide in late 1987 and that he
is still receiving psychological assistance. After
telephone conversations with leaders of five of the 15 Soviet
republics and with President Bush, Mr. Gorbachev headed for
Moscow from the Crimea. Although Yeltsin said he wanted a ``businesslike'' relationship
with Gorbachev, he also made an oblique call Thursday for Gorbachev
to give up one of his posts: either Soviet president or Communist
Party general secretary.
