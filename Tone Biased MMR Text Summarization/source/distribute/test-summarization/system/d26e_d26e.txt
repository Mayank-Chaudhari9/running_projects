The FAO said that as much as 2m tonnes of food aid could be needed for
southern Africa this year. ;
Causes: Drought, civil war; U.S. assistance(*)(*): $52,793,134; International
assistance: $34,341,739; There have been poor harvests for two years in a row,
and 1,165,000 tons of cereal grains are needed. In addition to its direct impact on agriculture, the drought will have
far-reaching consequences for the Zimbabwean economy. But in the
meantime there is little doubt that the drought, the cost of aid to farmers
and the planned expenditure on food imports will have figured in the South
African budget calculations due to be announced tomorrow. Agricultural economists point out that drought years are more the norm in
South Africa than the exception.
