``It is outrageous now to blame Michael Milken for losses as a
result of strategies and decisions that were implemented long after
he was no longer active at Drexel Burnham Lambert, and which he did
not endorse or agree with,'' the statement said. "Of course," said Mr. Boesky. And it is working on finding new 
capital for successful companies and refinancing firms that are in trouble. But whatever the future of Drexel and its once-star junk bond chief, it is 
clear that Milken is an exceptional individual who was driven from the very 
beginning with unusual determination. Most of his employees thought Mr. Milken was
generous with them.
