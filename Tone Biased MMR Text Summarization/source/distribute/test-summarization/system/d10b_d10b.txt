But it is Judge Bork's prolific and forceful writings as a law professor and judge that have earned him his reputation as an intellectual leader of conservative legal thought for a generation of law school graduates.

Judge Bork's supporters in the White House believe that all of this helped his cause, that it proved he wasn't, as one put it, "a neanderthal."
