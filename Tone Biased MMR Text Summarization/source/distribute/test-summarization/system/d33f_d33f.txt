To say the least, the Chinese 
side will not accept being led by the nose by the Hong Kong 
Legislative Council. But what we have 
concentrated on is not any of that. If a U.S. citizen commits a crime in China's 
territory, it will also be handled according to China's law. This will be a big disappointment for the people of Hong Kong. Mr Patten claims that by 1997 public spending in Hong Kong as a percentage
of GDP will be lower than it was in 1982 - the year Britain began handover
negotiations with China.
