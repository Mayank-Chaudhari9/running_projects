The source said the
younger Bush "sketched out for Sununu" problems the president is encountering
because of the chief of staff's tenure. The president denied he was angry with Mr.
Sununu and said his job was safe. Moreover, top Republicans
on Capitol Hill, as well as some administration officials,
say Mr. Skinner has a penchant for abrasiveness, although he
is hardly Mr. Sununu's equal on that score. White House spokesman
Marlin Fitzwater said that use of corporate planes for
political purposes is a "well-established practice" that Mr.
Sununu will continue. His boss, President Bush, is enjoying high public approval, important legislation is moving ahead and Mr. Sununu's relationship with the president is strong.
